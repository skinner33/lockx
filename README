lockx - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X. This is heavily based
on slock (http://www.suckless.org/wiki/tools/xlib) and the
main difference is that slock requires you to clear the buffer
(with enter, escape or backspaces) if you mistype your password,
whereas lockx will allways check the last (256 at most) entered
characters and try to match the password, so if you mistype, just
start over... No need to <ENTER> before or after...

e.g. by the time you have entered "sj2Sk@#" lockx will test:
"#"
"@#"
"k@#"
"Sk@#"
"2Sk@#"
"j2Sk@#"
"sj2Sk@#"

This might also be useful to avoid pranker friends to try to see your
password to browse your files or change configurations :P.


Requirements
------------
In order to build lockx you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (lockx is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install lockx (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running lockx
-------------
Simply invoke the 'lockx' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
